Tool selection guidance:
	1. Use 'list_*' tools for broad, simple retrieval and pagination of all items of a type (e.g., all issues, all PRs, all branches) with basic filtering.
	2. Use 'search_*' tools for targeted queries with specific criteria, keywords, or complex filters (e.g., issues with certain text, PRs by author, code containing functions).

Context management:
	1. Use pagination whenever possible with batches of 5-10 items.
	2. Use minimal_output parameter set to true if the full information is not needed to accomplish a task.

Tool usage guidance:
	1. For 'search_*' tools: Use separate 'sort' and 'order' parameters if available for sorting results - do not include 'sort:' syntax in query strings. Query strings should contain only search criteria (e.g., 'org:google language:python'), not sorting instructions.`

PR review workflow: Always use 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'create' to create a pending review, then 'add_comment_to_pending_review' to add comments, and finally 'pull_request_review_write' with method 'submit_pending' to submit the review for complex reviews with line-specific comments.`
	case "issues":
		return `## Issues

Check 'list_issue_types' first for organizations to use proper issue types. Use 'search_issues' before creating new issues to avoid duplicates. Always set 'state_reason' when closing issues.`
	case "discussions":
		return `## Discussions
		
Use 'list_discussion_categories' to understand available categories before creating discussions. Filter by category for better organization.`
	case "projects":
		return `## Projects

Read Tools:
	- list_projects
	- get_project
	- list_project_fields
	- get_project_field
	- list_project_items
	- get_project_item
Write Tools:
	- add_project_item
	- update_project_item
	- delete_project_item

Field usage:
	- Call list_project_fields first to understand available fields and get IDs/types before filtering.
	- Use EXACT returned field names (case-insensitive match). Don't invent names or IDs.
	- Iteration synonyms (sprint/cycle/iteration) only if that field exists; map to the actual name (e.g. sprint:@current).
	- Only include filters for fields that exist and are relevant.

Pagination (mandatory):
	Forward (normal) flow:
	- Loop while pageInfo.hasNextPage=true using after=pageInfo.nextCursor.
	- Keep query, fields, per_page IDENTICAL on every page.
	Backward (rare) flow:
	- Use before=pageInfo.prevCursor only when explicitly navigating to a previous page.
	Parameters:
	- per_page: results per page (max 50). Choose a stable value; do not change mid-sequence.
	- after: forward cursor from prior response (pageInfo.nextCursor).
	- before: backward cursor from prior response (pageInfo.prevCursor); seldom needed.

Fields parameter:
	- Include field IDs on EVERY paginated list_project_items call if you need values. Omit → title only.

Counting rules:
	- Count items array length after full pagination.
	- If multi-page: collect all pages, dedupe by item.id (fallback node_id) before totals.
	- Never count field objects, content, or nested arrays as separate items.
	- item.id = project item ID (for updates/deletes). item.content.id = underlying issue/PR ID.

Summary vs list:
	- Summaries ONLY if user uses verbs: analyze | summarize | summary | report | overview | insights.
	- Listing verbs (list/show/get/fetch/display/enumerate) → enumerate + total.

Examples:
	- list_projects: "roadmap is:open"
	- list_project_items: state:open is:issue sprint:@current priority:high updated:>@today-7d

Self-check before returning:
	- Paginated fully
	- Dedupe by id/node_id
	- Correct IDs used
	- Field names valid
	- Summary only if requested.

Return COMPLETE data or state what's missing (e.g. pages skipped).

list_project_items query rules:
Query string - For advanced filtering of project items using GitHub's search syntax:

MUST reflect user intent; strongly prefer explicit content type if narrowed:
	- "open issues" → state:open is:issue
	- "merged PRs" → state:merged is:pr
	- "items updated this week" → updated:>@today-7d (omit type only if mixed desired)
	- "list all P1 priority items" → priority:p1 (omit state if user wants all, omit type if user specifies "items")
	- "list all open P2 issues" → is:issue state:open priority:p2 (include state if user wants open or closed, include type if user specifies "issues" or "PRs")
	- "all open issues I'm working on" → is:issue state:open assignee:@me

Query Construction Heuristics:
	a. Extract type nouns: issues → is:issue | PRs, Pulls, or Pull Requests → is:pr | tasks/tickets → is:issue (ask if ambiguity)
	b. Map temporal phrases: "this week" → updated:>@today-7d
	c. Map negations: "excluding wontfix" → -label:wontfix
	d. Map priority adjectives: "high/sev1/p1" → priority:high OR priority:p1 (choose based on field presence)
	e. When filtering by label, always use wildcard matching to account for cross-repository differences or emojis: (e.g. "bug 🐛" → label:*bug*)
	f. When filtering by milestone, always use wildcard matching to account for cross-repository differences: (e.g. "v1.0" → milestone:*v1.0*)

Syntax Essentials (items):
   AND: space-separated. (label:bug priority:high).
   OR: comma inside one qualifier (label:bug,critical).
   NOT: leading '-' (-label:wontfix).
   Hyphenate multi-word field names. (team-name:"Backend Team", story-points:>5).
   Quote multi-word values. (status:"In Review" team-name:"Backend Team").
   Ranges: points:1..3, updated:<@today-30d.
   Wildcards: title:*crash*, label:bug*.
	 Assigned to User: assignee:@me | assignee:username | no:assignee

Common Qualifier Glossary (items):
   is:issue | is:pr | state:open|closed|merged | assignee:@me|username | label:NAME | status:VALUE |
   priority:p1|high | sprint-name:@current | team-name:"Backend Team" | parent-issue:"org/repo#123" |
   updated:>@today-7d | title:*text* | -label:wontfix | label:bug,critical | no:assignee | has:label

Pagination Mandate:
   Do not analyze until ALL pages fetched (loop while pageInfo.hasNextPage=true). Always reuse identical query, fields, per_page.

Never:
   - Infer field IDs; fetch via list_project_fields.
   - Drop 'fields' param on subsequent pages if field values are needed.`
